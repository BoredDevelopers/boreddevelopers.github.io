## Say goodbye to Passwords - Embrace Passkeys and OTPs for enhanced security

In this digital age where we are engaging in more and more apps, web apps and software solutions, where cybersecurity threats are ever-evolving, traditional passwords are increasingly seen as a weak link. Despite widespread use, or maybe because of its widespread use, passwords suffer from inherent vulnerabilities that make them less than ideal for securing sensitive information. It’s time to consider more robust alternatives like passkeys and one-time passwords (OTPs). That is exactly what we have done in Micronomy - the system that we are building. User experience and security are both on the top of our list of high priorities, for Micronomy, and that is also why we have made the bold decision NOT to use username and password for logins, just OTPs and Passkeys.

### So what’s the problems with Passwords?

    •	Predictability and Reusability: Many users create simple, easily guessable passwords or reuse the same password across multiple sites. This habit significantly increases the risk of unauthorized access if one password is compromised.
    •	Phishing Attacks: Cybercriminals often use phishing tactics to trick users into revealing their passwords. Once obtained, these credentials can be used to breach multiple accounts, especially if passwords are reused.
    •	Password Fatigue: With the multitude of online services requiring passwords, users often struggle to remember complex combinations, leading to weaker security practices like writing passwords down or using simplistic ones.

### And why is Passkeys and OTPs better?

#### Passkeys:

    •	Unique and Dynamic: Passkeys are unique to each device and account, offering a dynamic form of authentication that is difficult to replicate or steal.
    •	Eliminates Phishing Risks: Since passkeys do not rely on memorization and are device-bound, they significantly reduce the risk of phishing attacks. Users authenticate via biometrics or security tokens that are not easily phishable.
    •	Convenience and Security: Passkeys combine ease of use with robust security. They can be stored securely on devices and are often backed by biometric verification, making them both convenient and highly secure.

#### One-Time Passwords (OTPs):

    •	Single Use: OTPs are valid for only one session or transaction, making them useless to attackers after their initial use.
    •	Time-Limited: Often time-bound, OTPs add an extra layer of security by expiring after a short period, reducing the window of opportunity for potential misuse.
    •	Out-of-Band Delivery: OTPs can be delivered through separate communication channels, such as SMS or email, making it harder for attackers to intercept both the login request and the OTP.

We believe that Passkeys and OTPs provide more secure, user-friendly alternatives that mitigate many of the vulnerabilities associated with traditional passwords. By adopting these modern authentication methods, we can enhance security and simplify the user experience, paving the way for a safer digital future.
