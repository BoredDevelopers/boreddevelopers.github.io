##The importance a good working environment

Many of us have probably experienced OH&S (Operational Health & Safety) and/or HR (Human Resources) consultants visiting our desks at work and adjusting our seating height, desk height, chair tilt, light angle and posture. We might have found it annoying, even though they performed a very important function. However, most of us tended to ignore their advice once they left.

Besides sitting correctly and maintaining a good posture, the work environment we are in also affects another aspect - our productivity.

###Virtual office... effectively!

Can a virtual office be as effective and productive as a physical office?

We would say yes it can!

For all intents and purposes, we are sitting in an office together. We have a "office room" set up in our Teams and join it pretty much throughout the entire day. We chat and interact as if we were in a physical office together, which includes having a coffee, "fika", taking phone calls and throwing out questions if need be - exactly like you would in a physical office.

Working remotely isn't actually that hard and doesn't have to feel disconnected. 

###Clutter and "stuff" on the desk...

With a virtual office, our remote environments has to be focused and comfortable. We made the decision to include aspects of even our desk setup, to be individualised as well as an area where we could feel productive.

When you sit at the same desk, day in and day out, you tend to accumulate a significant amount of "stuff". Even on a daily basis, there's a coffee mug (or tea), maybe a bottle of water, pen(s), notepads, printouts and letters. Then there are cables, USB memory sticks and other accessories. It can quickly become a very busy, and hence not very relaxed or focused work area.

###The setup at Bored Developers...

We obviously were aware of some of the challenges you could face in a virtual environment, and feel that we had an answer to those. Now onto the physical environment, which is effectively an investment in ourselves and our well-being.

Seating is important, since you spend so much time in the chair, and here we looked at SecretLabs and have found them to be extremely comfortable, while also being affordable. A good chair is worth it's weight in gold.

The height adjustable standing desk also meant that we can fine-tune the exact height, both for sitting and standing, to our personal needs. Adding those heights into memory on the desk control made it very easy to get an accurate and repeatedly height on the desks with just the click of a button (can highly recommend investing in this).

Getting the "clutter free" environment was also a key point, in which the large Balolo Setup Cockpit really helped out. It had the attachments and mounting brackets for all of our accessories, effectively creating a productive and clutter free environment with all accessories easily accessible, such as mobile phone holders and chargers, laptop holders and Stream Deck mounts (this is another accessory that is highly recommendable).

The monitor arms was a god-send, as it could easily hold large monitors, while giving us personalised adjustments for however we wanted our monitors located and also giving us effective cable management as the cables can be routed through the arms themselves.

The last thing we included was the Benq Screenbar Halo. This part can not be understated. Having to work for long hours in front of a monitor, creates eye strain and obviously isn't good for either focus and eyesight. It has a backlight that is fully adjustable, both in the warmth and strength, and it effectively lights up your working environment without causing lighting glare on the screens. This is managed through the wireless controller.

The effect of this was immediately noticeable, with less eye strain and a more comfortable working environment, and wouldn't have been such noticeable different if we hadn't actually been using a more basic lighting bar to start with. That bar didn't have the adjustments available that this one had. This was by no means a cheap accessory, but experiencing the difference made it clear that there were so many more advantages in being able to easily adjust the lighting as much as we could (another recommendation).
